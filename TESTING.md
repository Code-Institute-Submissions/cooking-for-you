## Testing User Stories
---
1. As an elderly person who isn't great on computers the main appeal for me here was the simplicity of the site and ease of use. I would recommend it on that basis alone.
    
   * Easy to sign up, and get around the site.
   * Its easy to find the recipes and add my own, I wasn't expecting it to be so easy to add my own.

2. As a chef who is well used to recipes and how complicated they can get this website doesnt appeal to me too much. I'm looking for something a lot more detailed and specific.
   
   * Website is easy to move around but not specific enough for me with the recipes.
   * I do like the fact I can add my own recipes for other people without too much work.

3. As somebody who is just looking for a quick solution for a recipe this website was perfect. Broken down into 4 main categories (ones we all know).

    * I can access the recipes without having to sign up before hand is a huge plus.
    * No messing around searching everywhere for something so easy to find the recipe I wanted.

4. As a novice at cooking this website really appealed to me. Some of the other sites seem as if you need to be a chef just too even understand half of it, this was perfect for me.

    * The ease of moving around the site was great for me, so simple.
    * The registration process was easy enough as well, sign up there and then to access the whole site.

5. As a food critic I do enjoy being able to view sites like this to see what the people at home are making, very simplistic , I enjoyed it.

    * I enjoyed the registration process was hassle free doesnt look for too much info and I'm in the mailing list.
    * I also enjoy the fact I can add my own recipes.
