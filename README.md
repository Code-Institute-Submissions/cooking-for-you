# Milestone Project 3 - Cooking For You Website

The cooking for you website was created to enable people to look up existing recipes, create new ones and edit and delete them. It is aimed at people cooking at home, with the idea that we can make cooking that bit easier for you. Anybody can also log on and create recipes, enabling the likes of chefs etc to share knowledge with everybody.

# UX

I wanted to keep the design minimal enough for the user, as it is aimed at people just learning at home, didn't want to also overload them with website features.

The home page has a navbar with the home logo to the left and options to register,login or recipes. I have a carousel at the top of the page with colourful images of people and food for a nice visual appearance. Under this there are four bootstrap cards which have 4 main categories, meat, poulty, pasta and vegetarian. This simplifies the experience for the home user and allows them to click and go to the recipes of each category. Below is some text just explaining what we do followed by some social media links.

The recipes page again keeping to a minimal you will have the same 4 categories from the home page displayed at the top that you can click into for a recipes. Below this is a logo of a chef with food and the form to add your own recipes, the user will only be able to add a recipe to the same categories we have at the moment and will be unable to add a recipe unless logged in. Navbar and social links remain the same.

The login page, keeping up the same theme from the last page also has the chef logo at the top of the page and a form to log in with your details, navbar and social links kept the same. This is very easy for any user to login.

The register page is again same as login page, with the same logo and similar form to sign up and navbar and social links remain the same. The experience again being very easy to sign up for this from an elderly person at home to anyone of any age.

The recipes page again keeping it nice and simple has each recipe name in a jumbotrom and a link to click in to the individual recipe.

The recipe ingredients page for an individual recipe will again keep in the theme of the website and transition from the last page. The jumbotron with the name of the recipe is displayed at the top but the colour is now changed. You will again find the chef logo below followed by the ingredients, how to cook and any additional notes. Customers can edit or delete recipes from here with the two buttons at the bottom of the page. The only thing again is you will need to be signed in to edit or delete. Navbar and social links remain the same.

The edit recipes page will keep the same form as the recipes page to make sure the user has the same simple experience. Just fill in the same form again and submit, navbar and social links remain the same.

The delete recipe page again very minimal design, some text to warn the client if they delete the recipe there is no going back, with two buttons. One will bring you back to the recipes page. The other will delete the recipe.

The colour scheme was kept light and minimal aswell. A small grey scale for the navbar, the body an footer white, with the social links a grey scale. The brightest thing is the carousel and the jumbotron on the recipe page.
